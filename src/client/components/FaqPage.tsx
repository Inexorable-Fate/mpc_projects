                <Accordion.Header as='h3' id='why'><span>Why do I have to install a browser extension? Why can&rsquo;t I just have links to projects on MPC?</span><span className="hidden">This seems like a lot of trouble. Can I just have a link to an MPC project?</span></Accordion.Header>
                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>The extension, and subsequently Inexorable Fate, were created specifically to prevent the problems that come with direct links to MPC projects. MPC was not intended for free sharing of projects; sharable projects were created to be sold in the MPC marketplace for a profit. Members of the Arkham Horror community do not want to violate <a href='https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/fa/b1/fab15a15-94a6-404c-ab86-6a3b0e77a7a0/ip_policy_031419_final_v21.pdf'>FFG&rsquo;s policy for community use of IP</a> by profiting off custom content, so they found a workaround to share MPC projects for free.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, this meant that any changes to a project changed it not just for the person placing the order but for everyone who viewed it thereafter. Projects were frequently found to be missing cards or have been partially overwritten by another campaign. Some unfortunate fans wasted large sums of money printing projects that turned out to be damaged. And because creating a project on MPC is time-consuming, popular campaigns were often unavailable for months until someone had the time to recreate the project.</p>
                  <p>The extension allows projects to be created quickly, ensures that projects can&rsquo;t be accidentally damaged for everyone by someone making their own MPC order, and allows for easy editing and combining of projects, saving you time and, theoretically, money. Although you may find the whole thing so easy that you print twice as much as you would have otherwise.</p>

                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>Yes! You can save time by uploading images in bulk; the extension will automatically pair fronts and backs based on the filenames. MPC Project Helper then creates a json-formatted project file with links to the already uploaded images.</p>
                  <p>As MPC charges less per card as the project size increases, you can also save money by combining several projects into one before printing.</p>

                  <p>Unfortunately the projects on Inexorable Fate are only compatible with MPC. If you need projects for other sites, <a href='/faq#maintain'>see </a> for assistance.</p>

                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>AHLCG cards are a non-standard size of 61.5mm x 88.6mm. The best match on MPC is Custom Game Cards 63 x 88mm. The height difference is insignificant, but the width differential is noticeable.</p>
                  <p>For the card stock, the general consensus is that S33 Superior Smooth is closest to FFG cards, but a little bit thicker. S30 Standard Smooth is slightly thinner but also acceptable, especially if you sleeve.</p>

                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>The red dotted lines indicating the safe print area do seem concerning, as sometimes part of the card title or other important elements may fall outside this line. However, this is the worst case scenario on any given edge of the card, and the actual final crop is rarely that far off in any direction. (Although it can happen.)</p>
                  <p>If the card image you see on MPC, ignoring the red line, looks the way you expect the card to look, then you&rsquo;ve uploaded it correctly and you shouldn&rsquo;t be alarmed by how much of an AHLCG card falls outside that red line.</p>

                <p>If you need extra copies of official cards, your options right now are to buy another copy of the box they came in or to use proxies. We can&rsquo;t help you print cards in violation of FFG&rsquo;s IP. The money you spend on AHLCG products from FFG supports all the people involved in creating and producing it, and helps ensure that FFG will continue making this game we all love.</p>
                <p>We&rsquo;re as upset as you are about the out-of-print content, but unfortunately we can&rsquo;t make that available here unless FFG releases it as PnP. Hopefully they will either do that or repackage it for sale.</p>
