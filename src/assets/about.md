<h1>About Inexorable Fate</h1>

<p class="lead">Inexorable Fate is a site to streamline finding and professionally printing custom content for Arkham Horror: The Card Game and official print-and-play AHLCG content released by Fantasy Flight Games (FFG). Using the project files hosted here requires the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mpc-project-helper/oigcfklkajlgkeblpngmbgjniiejabko">MPC Project Helper</a>, a Chrome extension to streamline the creation and sharing of projects on <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/">MakePlayingCards.com</a> (MPC).</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>It started with the purchase as a single Arkham Horror core set. Before long it had ballooned into owning all the official content and the desperate need to experience all the custom content as well. And like most of you, we just wanted an easier way to get professionally printed copies of the the fabulous homebrew content created by the Arkham Horror community.</p> 
<p>MPC was not intended for free sharing of projects. Sharable projects were created to be sold in the MPC marketplace for a profit. Members of the Arkham Horror community do not want to violate <a href="https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/fa/b1/fab15a15-94a6-404c-ab86-6a3b0e77a7a0/ip_policy_031419_final_v21.pdf">FFG's policy for community use of their IP</a> by profiting off custom content, so they found a workaround to share MPC projects for free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this meant that any changes to a project changed it not just for the person placing the order but for everyone who viewed it thereafter. Projects were frequently found to be missing cards or have been partially overwritten by another campaign. Because creating a project on MPC is time-consuming, popular campaigns were often unavailable for months until someone had the time to recreate the project.</p>
<p>North101 created the MPC Project Helper Chrome extension both to streamline the project creation process and to make projects sharable without the potential to accidentally break the original project. In addition, it allows you to quickly combine multiple projects for cheaper printing, since the cost per card goes down with larger projects.</p>
<p>Coldtoes volunteered to test the extension; loved it; appointed herself its evangelist; and began maintaining a repository of projects on a Google Drive. North saw the potential in making the projects searchable and filterable, and Inexorable Fate was born.</p>

            Does the extension work with card printing sites other than MPC?

         <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Yes. The extension also runs on <a href="http://printerstudio.com/">PrinterStudio.com</a>, <a href="http://printerstudio.co.uk/">PrinterStudio.co.uk</a>, and <a href="http://printerstudio.com.hk/">PrinterStudio.com.hk</a>.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately the projects on Inexorable Fate are only compatible with MPC. If you need projects for other sites, <a href="#q-contact">contact Coldtoes</a> for assistance.</p>

            If I just want to create my own project files and I'm not planning to share them, will I still find the extension useful?

      <div id="a-why" class="accordion-collapse collapse"  aria-labelledby="q-why" data-bs-parent="#faq">
         <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Yes! You can save time by uploading images in bulk; the extension will automatically pair fronts and backs based on the filenames. MPC Project Helper then creates a json-formatted project file with links to the already uploaded images.</p>

            I've uploaded cards with bleed but the red dotted line for MPC's "safe area" still shows parts of my cards cut off. Should I worry?

      <div id="a-bleed" class="accordion-collapse collapse"  aria-labelledby="q-bleed" data-bs-parent="#faq">
         <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The red dotted lines indicating the safe print area may seem concerning, as sometimes part of the card title or other important elements may fall outside this line. However, this is an unlikely worst case scenario on any given edge of the card.</p>

            <p>Coldtoes would love to help make your project available for print! [Contact her] and share your cards and she'll make a project for the site. (If you make the project yourself, someone will have to contact you to refresh it whenever they want to print it, so we've found it's easiest to have most projects for public use on a single account.)</p>
