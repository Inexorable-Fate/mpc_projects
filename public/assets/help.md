    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The <strong>Search</strong> box in the navigation allows you to search for projects by title.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As you type, the list will be narrowed to projects including the string of characters you&rsquo;ve typed in their name.

    </ol>
    <h3 id="filter">Filtering Projects</h3>
    <p>Filters, indicated by the funnel icon, provide an even more powerful way to narrow the project list.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
      <p>There are currently three categories of filter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You can find the work of specific content creators using <strong>Authors</strong> filter. The list of projects will immediately update to projects by the selected author(s). To view only official PnP content, filter on the author &ldquo;Fantasy Flight Games&rdquo;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <strong>Tags</strong> filter contains information on the type(s) of content included in a project, such as Campaign, Standalone, Player Cards, and Investigators.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The <strong>Status</strong> filter provides more information about the status of the project on Inexorable Fate. Pay special attention to projects tagged &ldquo;Needs QA&rdquo; or &ldquo;Changes Pending.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Projects that <strong>Need QA</strong> have not yet been double-checked to ensure all cards have been uploaded correctly, so it&rsquo;s recommended you give them an extra check before printing. (And let us know your findings!)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>We suggest you hold off on any projects marked <strong>Changes Pending</strong>. Typically these need fixes either upcoming from the homebrew author or to the project file, and an improved version will be available shortly. You can usually see more information about what the issues are by clicking the info button (to the right of the card count).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Filters can be selected from the filter dropdowns at the top, or by clicking on an author name, tag, etc. within a project to find other, similar content.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Selecting multiple filters in the same category <strong>broadens</strong> your search, so choosing both Campaign and Investigator tags won&rsquo;t will get you projects with either the Campaign <strong>OR</strong> the Investigator tag, not projects with both. But selecting filters in different categories <strong>narrows</strong> your search. Selecting author Fantasy Flight Games and status Ongoing will find projects that are both by FFG <strong>AND</strong> which are preiodically updated, like Parallels and Taboo.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>To clear a filter, choose &ldquo;Select None&rdquo; at the bottom of the filter dropdown, or click the <strong>Inexorable Fate</strong> logo in the header to return to the unfiltered homepage.

    <h3 id="combine-edit">Combining and Editing Projects (Optional)</h3>
    <p>As MPC charges a flat fee for a given number of cards, you can save money by combining several smaller projects for a lower cost per card than if you print them separately. You may even be able to print a smaller project for free by combining it with a larger project you are also printing, so check <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/design/custom-blank-card.html">MPC&rsquo;s pricing</a> to determine whether combining projects will be advantageous.
    </p>
    <p>The bottom right corner will show your total card count out of the maximum project size on MPC (612 for Arkham Horror-sized cards). If your total exceeds the max, the extension will automatically split it into multiple projects.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>You may select additional <code>.json</code> files to combine multiple projects into one. Use the draggable handles on the left to reorder projects as desired.

        <p>When you are happy with the project, click <strong>Upload</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Choose your desired print settings. The following settings are recommended for Arkham Horror LCG:</p>
        <p><strong>Product:</strong> Custom Game Cards (63 x 88mm).</p>
        <p><strong>Card Stock:</strong> S33 Superior Smooth (S33 is closest to FFG cards, but a little bit thicker. S30 Standard Smooth is slightly thinner but also acceptable, especially if you sleeve.)
        </p>
        <p><strong>Project name:</strong> This is just for your own reference but may need to be shortened to fit MPC&rsquo;s max length. At the very least you can remove (card count).json.</p>
        <p>Other settings can be left at the default.</p>

        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now click <strong>Open Project (1/1)</strong>. This will open your project on MPC in a new tab. It may take a minute for the page to load so don't panic if initially all you see is a white screen.
        </p>

  <h3 id="view-on-mpc">Viewing Your Project on MPC</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>You will see you have leapfrogged to Step 5 of MPC's project design, bypassing the first four time-consuming steps.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you are loading a project that someone else created, even after giving the page time to load, you may see broken image icons instead of the card images you expect. This is due to the way MPC caches images — it is likely that if you printed the project it would print correctly (one person has tested this and it was successful), but this is an understandably big risk, given the cost of MPC printing and shipping.
      </p>
      <img class="mt-2 mb-4" width=500 src="/assets/images/screenshot-broken-image.png"/>
      <p>The way to resolve this problem is to contact the person who created the project file and ask them to click
        <strong>Edit</strong> on their saved project(s), allowing the images to reload. Once they have done this, you should be able to see the images in your account as well.

  <section id="images-tab">
    <h2 class="display-4">Create a Project from Card Images</h2>
    <h3 id="image-prep">Preparing Images for Upload</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Prepare your images for upload by having one individual file for each unique card image.</p>
        <p>Minimum resolution for printing Arkham Horror-sized cards at MPC are 750 x 1050 px at 300dpi, with 36px bleed on all sides, so your final size should be at least 822 x 1122 px. See <a href="https://www.makeplayingcards.com/pops/faq-photo.html">MPC's bleed guidelines</a> for more information and details on other card sizes.
        </p>
        <p>Bleed is an extension of the card art/design so that if the cut is slightly off you won't end up with an unprinted strip of white cardstock on one edge. You can automatically add mirrored bleed to cards in Strange Eons by downloading <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MpJ9UAUHsSkvmegd4WTy3-kX5AMB1GZ-/view?usp=share_link">this script</a> and putting its path in the <strong>Postprocess each image using a script</strong> field of <strong>Bulk Export</strong> settings. Or you can use the Python script <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JcuCjJRC2p3jvw2FVMfsLN1qv0Oqv6Us?usp=drive_link">bleedy</a> by Olivia Juliet and North101 to create mirrored bleed in bulk on individual images.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure all cards are oriented vertically, and rotated so that the right edge of the front and the left edge of the back are both on the right. For Arkham Horror LCG horizontal cards (acts, agendas, and investigators), rotate the images so that lines of text on the front run from the bottom of the card to the top, and on the other side from top to bottom. (When previewing the front and back side by side, the bottoms of both faces should meet in the middle.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The suggested naming pattern is to prefix your cards with a card number followed by the card or project name and to suffix all card fronts with -a (or -1 or -front) and backs with -b (or -2 or -back. The identical names (except for the suffix) allow the project helper to automatically pair the front and back of each card. The numerical prefix ensures the extension will organize the cards in the desired order.
        </p>
        <p>Your file names should now look like this:</p>
        <p><code>
        001-card-a.png<br/>
        001-card-b.png<br/>
        002-card-a.png<br/>
        002-card-b.png<br/>
        </code></p>
      <li>
        <p>If you have a common front or back card (e.g. AHLCG encounter or player back) you can leave off the number
          and name your files like this:
        </p>
        <p><code>
        back.png<br/>
        001-card-a.png<br/>
        002-card-a.png<br/>
        003-card-a.png<br/>
        003 card-b.png </code><em>(this will take priority over back.png)</em><br/>
        </p>
        <p>An image with the name <code>back</code> will automatically be recognized as the default back and assigned to any fronts without an identically named back. Or you can select a default back after importing with the extension.
        </p>
        <p>Since the extension only allows a single default back, if you have more than one back image that is used on a number of your cards, you have two choices:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>You can choose the one you have the most of (often the encounter card back) to use as the default back and make a copy of others (like player card backs) for each card front requiring it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Or, you can upload all your player cards as one project with a default player back, then make a second project with the default encounter back, and, finally, combine the two projects into one. See <a href="#creator-combine-edit">Combining and Editing Projects</a> for more details.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <li>
        <p>To print multiple, identical copies of a card, put a card count preceded by -x before the front/back flag:
        </p>
        <code>
        back.png<br/>
        001-card-a.png </code><em>(prints a single copy of card 001)</em><br/>
        <code>002-card-x2-a.png </code><em>(prints two copies of card 002)</em><br/>
        <code>003-card-x5-a.png </code><em>(prints five copies of card 003)</em><br/>
        <code>003-card-x5-b.png
        </code>
