**2025-08-01:**
  - Replaced Inner Chamber in the Monterey Jack scenario Relics of the Past with the errata version from FAQ 2.4.

**2025-01-02:**
  - Added minicard for Parallel Jenny with Aconyte art. (Note that this is the first Parallel to use different art from the standard version of the investigator so is the only one with a minicard.)

**2024-08-03:**
  - All or Nothing’s Clover Club Bouncer, which had previously been uploaded as four identical copies of the card all with the same encounter set number (6/9), is now four cards with sequential set numbers (6/9, 7/9, 8/9, 9/9).

**2023-11-01:**
  - Replaced Parallel Jim back, which was incorrectly exported by Coldtoes. Sorry.
