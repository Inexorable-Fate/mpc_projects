**2026-01-15:**
  - Several treacheries had incorrect quantites:
    - 032 Skulking Hooligan 2 -> 3
    - 094 Immolated Dancer 2 -> 3
    - 099 Vanitas 3 -> 4
    - 128 Babas Servant 1 -> 2
    - 129 Congregation of Sorrows 1 -> 3
    - 332 Syndicate Fixer 2 -> 3
    - 346 Collective Unconscious 2 -> 1
    - 349 Designated Victim 1 -> 2
    - 362 Pale Observer 2 -> 3
  - There are two versions of printable errata for the incorrect quantities:
    - Just the 8 missing cards (plus you should remove one copy of Collective Unconscious). Collection numbers will match your printing but the encounter set totals will be off.
    - The entire four encounter sets with missing or extra cards — Nyctophobia, The Commission, Giallo, Megalopolisomancy — renumbered. This will ensure the encounter set totals match are correct. Also the 5 missing cards from scenarios End of Seasons, Dancing with Death, and The Teachings of Aradia. Those encounter set totals will be short by 1–2 cards, but that doesn’t seem worth reprinting 130 cards.

**2026-01-15:**
  - Renumbered cards in line with FFG numbering conventions
  - Improved templating on a number of cards

**2025-10-17:**
  - Added the Campaign Expansion.
