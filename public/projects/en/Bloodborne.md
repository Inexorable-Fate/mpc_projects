**2024-11-09:**
  - The Agents of Ebrietas encounter set (306–309) was updated to have 4 copies of Sidereal Flux instead of one, for a total of 9 cards in the set instead of 6.
  - The Brain of Mensis was moved from the Moon encounter set, where it had been incorrectly placed, to the Living String encounter set. As a result, cards 393–406 have been renumbered to reflect the new order and correct encounter set totals.
