**2025-12-03:**
A few problems have been corrected since the updated export on 2025-11-19:
  - Scenario 1 Act 2 (6–7) and Scenario 4 Agenda 1 (88–90) had unintentional duplicates that have been removed. The correct number is two versions of S1 act 2 and three versions of S4 agenda 1 with identical fronts and different backs.
  - Scenario 5 Act 1 cards (125–128) have been replaced with versions with identically numbered fronts so that they are indistinguishable on the “a” side.
  - Numbing Mist (274) now has 2 copies instead of 1.
  
**2025-11-19:**
  - Re-exported at 450ppi
  - Perfectionist formatting updates including improved hanging indents, en dashes to match FFG templating, periods after Victory X, correct templating on fight/evade/investigate/parley when not used as an action, improve line breaks and vertical spacing on flavor text

**2024-11-19:**
  - Due to an update in the Strange Eons plugin to correct the templating for the Patrol keyword, several Patrol enemies (56, 60, 61, 293) were inadvertently missing the word “Patrol.” This has now been rectified.
  - Two additional Patrol enemies (183, 185) were not missing the Patrol keyword, but have now been reformatted with the correct templating for Patrol.

**2024-11-09:**
  - The Agents of Ebrietas encounter set (306–309) was updated to have 4 copies of Sidereal Flux instead of one, for a total of 9 cards in the set instead of 6.
  - Due to a proofreading error by the Inexorable Fate team, The Brain of Mensis  had been incorrectly placed in the Moon encounter set. It has now been moved to the Living String encounter set where it belongs. As a result, cards 393–406 have been renumbered to reflect the new order and correct encounter set totals.
