**2024-11-17:**
- Due to an update in the Strange Eons plugin to correct the templating for the Patrol keyword, several Patrol enemies (56, 60, 61, 293) were inadvertently missing the word “Patrol.” This has now been rectified.
- Two additional Patrol enemies (183, 185) were not missing the Patrol keyword, but have now been reformatted with the correct templating for Patrol.

**2024-11-09:**
  - The Agents of Ebrietas encounter set (306–309) was updated to have 4 copies of Sidereal Flux instead of one, for a total of 9 cards in the set instead of 6.
  - Due to a proofreading error by the Inexorable Fate team, The Brain of Mensis  had been incorrectly placed in the Moon encounter set. It has now been moved to the Living String encounter set where it belongs. As a result, cards 393–406 have been renumbered to reflect the new order and correct encounter set totals.
