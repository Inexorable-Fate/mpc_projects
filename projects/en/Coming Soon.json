  "description": "MPC’s Black Friday sale is starting soon, typically followed by a Cyber Monday sale the week after Thanksgiving. But you may want to wait a few days to place your order, as we’re racing to prepare the following projects for the site: Circus Ex Mortis, The Colour Out of Oz, Don’t Starve, Hellboy, Team Fortress 2, Tintin, and Hercule Poirot, all by fan favorite The Beard. Plus 5argon has made some beautiful refractions, boons, and ultimatums from Taboo 2.3. Also, note that if you printed Bloodborne before 20 Nov, make sure to check out its changelog as you may want to print at least some of the errata.",
