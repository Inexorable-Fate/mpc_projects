  "description": "MPC’s Black Friday sale is here, typically followed by a Cyber Monday sale the week after Thanksgiving. And so are the following new projects for the site: Circus Ex Mortis, The Colour Out of Oz, Don’t Starve, Hellboy, Tintin, and Hercule Poirot, all by fan favorite The Beard. (Note that Team Fortress 2 has not yet been QAed and will be posted soon.) Plus 5argon has made some beautiful refractions, boons, and ultimatums from Taboo 2.3. Also, note that if you printed Bloodborne before 20 Nov, make sure to check out its changelog as you may want to print at least some of the errata.",
