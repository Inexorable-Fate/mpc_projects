  "description": "MPC’s Black Friday sale is here, typically followed by a Cyber Monday sale the week after Thanksgiving. And so are a host of new projects for the site — use the Sort feature to sort by Newest to pull the most recent additions to the top of the list. Still coming soon: The Beard’s Team Fortress 2. Also, note that if you printed Bloodborne before 20 Nov, make sure to check out its changelog as you may want to print at least some of the errata.",
